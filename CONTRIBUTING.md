## Considerations

- Please don't upload big screenshots
- Don't use GIFs, GIFs can be too much for some people with low bandwidth (or navigating from a phone), also if the height is too large it can cover all the viewport and being unrespectful of others' profiles.
- Be sure the screenshot DOESN'T show any image or text promoting real, psychological, or simulated violence against any individual or group. If any profile is found violating this, should be removed.
