Commit message format: feat: Added [add your Profile Name>] profile :zap:
6. Open and submit a PR. :tada:

## Considerations

- Please don't upload big screenshots
- Don't use GIFs, GIFs can be too much for some people with low bandwidth (or navigating from phone), also if the height is too large it can cover all the viewport and being unrespectful of other profiles.
- Be sure the screenshot DON'T shows any image or text promoting real, psychological, or simulated violence against any individual or group. If any profile is found violating this, should be removed.
